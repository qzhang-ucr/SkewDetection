# SkewDetection
The skew detection contains two parts: computation skew detection and data skew detection

Put logfile in result-for-computation, and run the TestComputationSkew to get if there is computation skew, run the TestDataSkew to get if there is data skew. Program will chose the lastest logfile. The result will be in result-for-computation

The data sets for all the example projects are in the README.md for aas: https://github.com/sryza/aas
