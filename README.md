# SkewDetection
The skew detection contains two parts: computation skew detection and data skew detection

Put logfile in chap5, and run the TestComputationSkew to get if there is computation skew, run the TestDataSkew to get if there is data skew. Program will chose the lastest logfile

The data sets for all the example projects are in the README.md for aas: https://github.com/sryza/aas
